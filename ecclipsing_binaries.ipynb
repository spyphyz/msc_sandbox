    "A number of confirmed exoplanetary systems exist within the realm of binary star systems. Why chose ecclipsing binaries as targets for exoplanetary research? The prevalence of binary systems that host at least one FGKM star is high. Exoplanets have been confirmed in binary systems - both cirbumbinary planets (CBPs) and planets orbiting an individual star. Exoplanet orbits are more likely to be found in the ecciptic - the ecclipsing binaries are a subpopulation of stars where alignment of planetary transit may be more favourable to Earthly astronomers. The combination of transit observation with astrometry - in particular relative astrometry with its potential for nano-arcsecond precision - can create rich exobody parameter data and system architecture information. Interesting habitable zone (HZ) options arise in binary systems, making exploration of this parameter space in models interesting and inciteful. \n",
